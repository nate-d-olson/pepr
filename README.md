# PEPR --Pipeline for Evaluating Prokaryotic References
Bioinformatic Pipeline for evaluating and charcterizing a reference genome sequence for a prokaryotic reference material using replicate whole genome sequencing data from orthogonal sequencing methods.  This pipeline is being developed for the characterization of NIST candidate microbial genomic DNA reference materials and is provided to the research community for use in characterizing other prokaryotic genomic materials.
